# Openssl tools

A small collection of tools that work with openssl.

Initial x509 idea came from  Courtney Cotton's  [python-csr](https://github.com/cjcotton/python-csr)

Very very rough, but works.

Built this in visual studio with python plugin, as I look at this same code in pycharm some issues still to fix.
